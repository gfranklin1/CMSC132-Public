Only Project 3, 5, 7, and 8 offered extra credit.

### Project 1: Tube Videos Manager
Grade: 100/100

Developed a video management system in Java that includes features such as playlist creation, video addition, and search functionality.

### Project 2: Web Page Generator
Grade: 100/100

Developed a Java-based HTML generation system for building dynamic web pages by utilizing object-oriented programming principles to create classes for various HTML elements such as anchor elements, headings, images, lists, tables, paragraphs, and text elements.

### Project 3: Clear Cell Game
Grade: 102.5/100 (2.5 EC for completing the first few release tests early)

Developed a ClearCell game in java that utilized object-oriented programming and algorithms to handle random cell generation, clearing cells, and creating each animation frame.

### Project 4: Game (Blitz)
Grade: 100/100

Developed a 2D top-down shooter game using Java with its AWT libraries, where I implemented multiple game mechanics and features such as player input controls, enemies spawning randomly, collision detection, multiple weapons with unique features, health management and damage systems with their own UI components, and many more.

### Project 5: Linked Lists
Grade: 102.5/100 (2.5 EC for completing the first few release tests early)

Implemented a basic linked list data structure in Java, providing functionality for adding elements to the front or end of the list, remove specific elements, and generate both a reversed ArrayList or Linked List version of the list.

Developed a generic sorted linked list that ensures elements are maintained in a sorted manner according to the comparator.

### Project 6: Online Test
Grade: 100/100

Developed an online exam management system in Java, with classes for students, exams, answers, questions, etc. SystemManager acts as a main system where it manages exams, students, answer submissions, grading, and overall data management. 

### Project 7: Binary Search Tree
Grade: 81.5/100 (passed 29/50 secret tests, 2.5 EC for completing the first few release tests early)

Implemented a binary search tree (BST) data structure in Java, supporting operations such as adding elements, deleting specific elements, finding elements, and generating subtrees within specified ranges.

### Project 8: Orders Processor
Grade: 102.5/100 (2.5 EC for completing the first few release tests early)

Implemented an OrdersProcessor in Java, utilizing multithreading for efficient processing of orders. The program takes user input for item data, number of orders, and file names, then processes orders from multiple files concurrently if specified.

Utilized Java's multithreading capabilities for parallel processing of orders, optimizing performance for large datasets.

### Project 9: Graphs
Grade: 100/100

Implemented a Graph data structure in Java for representing and processing graphs. The implementation includes methods for adding vertices and directed edges, performing breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths.

Utilized HashMaps for adjacency properties and vertex data storage, prioritized data structures such as PriorityQueue for efficient algorithm execution, and implemented inner classes for encapsulation of vertex information.
